# COVID-19 Theory & Thoughts    
> I'll start by saying that this is a conspiracy theory and there is no claim of proof

I was thinking about the COVID-19 pandemic today and I started to wonder - 
  - If this can deteriorate your heart or lung function, can it do further damage with each subsequent infection? If it can, then over time, will it kill off those people and families who experience this effect; will they be erased; will those gene pools cease to exist? If they will, then is this a form of genocide?  
  - If this was developed by a country, then I can only come up with a couple of reasons to develop it; to defend against other countries deploying something similar, or to be the country that releases it into the world.  
  - If the goal was to release it someday, then was the goal also to target certain people?
  - If it was developed by China, and the goal was to target certain people, then was it developed as a form of population control?
  - If it was developed as a form of population control, to weed out certain people, then is it a new attempt at an old goal of another country?

As I said, these were just a few thoughts that came to mind while thinking about COVID-19.
