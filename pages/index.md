## Purpose

This was created to integrate with the Prometheus monitoring solution which I architected.  


## Features

The Runbooks in `/docs` are searchable, and links are created to these when alerts fire from Prometheus. There are integrations with Slack and PagerDuty, for quick reference to runbooks during impacts.
