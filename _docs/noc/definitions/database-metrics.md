# database-metrics  

### Uptime %  
  *	Used to measure uptime / availability.  
  *	Issues with this metric equate to reduced revenue generation.  
  
### Response Time ms  
  *	Measurement of how long it takes the application or infrastructure to respond.  
  *	Poor response time indicates communication or processing issues along the application path.  
  
### Error Rate %  
  *	Percentage of errors generated per minute.  
  *	Higher error rates indicate problems with the application or the hosted infrastructure.  
  
### Requests per Second  
  *	Indication of incoming load to the environment; precursor to other load indicators.  
  *	Higher numbers mean that the environment will start to experience heavy load.  
  
### Fast, Slow, Very Slow, Stalled, Failed Requests  
  *	Indicates how Application Transactions are performing.  
  *	Poor numbers indicate an issue with a transaction or the hardware supporting the application.  
  
### Utilization %  
  *	Percentage of time that the database is busy.  
  *	High utilization will affect uptime.  
  
### Number Current Connections  
  *	How many active connections to the database?  
  *	Too many can result in degraded performance.  
  
### Concurrency  
  *	How many jobs are being processed at the same time?  
  *	More jobs equates to more load, and is a precursor to performance issues.  
  
### Execution Time ms  
  *	How long are jobs in the database?  
  *	Indication of database processing issues
