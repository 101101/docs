# ops-readiness  

### What does it mean to operationalize something in the NOC?

 - [ ] Customer was engaged and discussed what they want to achieve.  
 - [ ] Monitoring agents deployed to devices and applications.  
 - [ ] We have a documented and implemented ways to ensure that the agents are up and accurate.  
      * This includes ways to install, uninstall, start, stop, restart, and upgrade the agents.  
 - [ ] Core monitors and agreed thresholds implemented.  
 - [ ] Identified any additional monitoring to implement, with thresholds.  
 - [ ] Documented processes to follow when alerts occur.  
      * Our processes are accurately associated to the things which would invoke action.  
 - [ ] We know who to contact when an issue arrises, when to escalate, and who else to engage - other infrastructure or application teams, stakeholders, etc...  
 - [ ] We have clear and concise communication methods for the customer.  
 - [ ] We have worked with the customer to identify which reports to create and the frequency to deliver them.  
 - [ ] We can actively review alerts in the environment and provide recommendations to improve monitoring, while reducing alert noise or false positives.  
 - [ ] We have established an open dialogue and are part of the customer's pipeline - making updates to, adding new, or removing devices, applications, or monitors as the solution evolves.  
 - [ ] We can identify trends in the environment and recommend solutions for the customer.  
 - [ ] We have internal processes which allow us to increase efficiency and effectiveness.
