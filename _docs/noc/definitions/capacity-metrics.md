# Core Targeted Capacity Metrics  
> Used to identify when environments should be grown, to handle increasing demand on resources. While these metrics are intended for growth planning, they will also have a hard upper limit for alerting, since maxing them out will have impactful results in the environment.

**CPU –** % Utilization, % Busy, and Wait time  

**Memory –** % Utilization  

**Disk –** % Utilization, I/O Wait time, Queue Length  

**Apdex Rating –** Lower Apdex rating indicates poor user satisfaction with product performance  
  * `((# Satisfactory samples) + (0.5 * (# Tolerating samples))) / Total number samples = Apdex Score`
