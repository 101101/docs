  * **Capacity –** Used to gauge upgrades to the environment  
  
  * **Alert to Incident ratio –** Level of noise in the environment  
  
  * **Noisy metrics and Incidents –** Areas where attention is required to improve performance  
  
  * **First to Know (FTK) –** Indication of our ability to identify issues before customers  
  
  * **Average Response Time –** How quickly we are able to identify an issue and react, by priority  
  
  * **Velocity –** Ingestion to Automation ratio – Work items moved to us vs our Automated items
